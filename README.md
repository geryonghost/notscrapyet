# Not Scrap Yet
## Theory behind the project
When I shop for a car, I like to find a very specific make, model, and options. However using the tools that are available it makes it very difficult. I was hoping to use web scraping technology to scrap dealers websites to compile a comprehensive search engine for used cars.

## Problems
1. I have really struggled with the ability to scale the scraping to any dealer website.
2. I do not have the $$$ to invest in web scraping tooling.

## Current State
1. The node.js app uses MongoDB and has basic functionality. This is light because I never had more than a handful of dealers worth of data.
2. The python will scrap a single dealer, use the VIN to reference the NHTSA to standardize various features and options.

## Help
If anyone wants to help me create a comprehensive used (possibly new) car ad aggregator and can help with the python, node, web scraping and possibly LLM this is your chance.
